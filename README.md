# Food Vision Frontend

This project is a web application written in Flutter that aims to serve as the client interface for the machine learning model, and back-end API I wrote using Python, TensorFlow, FastAPI, and deployed using Docker. The back-end API repository which includes the jupyter notebook used in creating the model can be accessed through this [link](https://github.com/eRuaro/food-vision-api).

The front-end is deployed to Heroku via serving with Node.Js, and Express. You can view the deployed app through this [link](https://food-vision-ruaro.herokuapp.com/).
